# Continuity Kernel

A practical risk‑gating layer for agents that keeps work on track when stakes are real.

## Why try it
- Stop costly missteps: high‑risk actions require explicit confirmation.
- Fewer dead‑ends: avoid repeating failed paths with reusable SuccessPath procedures.
- Less friction: low‑intervention reality checks prevent “plan drift” without nagging.

## What you get
- A ready‑to‑use API that adds guardrails to any agent workflow.
- Minimal, stable memory: `Shell` for interface, `SuccessPath` for proven procedures.
- MCP adapter for Claude Code, Codex, and other MCP‑compatible hosts.

## Ideal for
- Teams running real operations where errors cost money or time.
- Builders who want predictable, auditable agent behavior.
- Long‑running collaborations that need continuity, not just answers.
