# Open Source Scope (v1.0)

## Recommend to open-source now
- Core protocol docs (continuity, reality-first, L4 gate semantics)
- Object schemas (`Shell`, `SuccessPath`), API contracts, MCP adapter
- Example payloads and E2E scripts
- Minimal runnable skeleton (FastAPI + Postgres + pgvector)

## Keep private for now
- Production scoring thresholds or tuning data
- Any user-specific datasets or logs
- Internal operational playbooks

## Papers
Do not include the three papers in the initial repo.
Reason: they are research artifacts with different audience and review cycles.
If you want them public, publish as a separate repo or add later under `/research/` with explicit license.
